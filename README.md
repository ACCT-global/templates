# ACCT templates.
- A collection of templates that serve as a starting point to any team that wishes to improve their descriptions and organization overall.
- Feel free to create a Pull Request if you have any ideia in how to improve those templates.

# Overall Observations.
1. Please keep in mind that for now, we only have templates for `gitlab` because it's mainly where all ACCT project are being kept.
2. There will be more templates based on `issues` and even some `unit tests practices`.
3. Templates will be kept in folders that refers to the language they are written.
